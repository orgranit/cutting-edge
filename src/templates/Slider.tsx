But the one disaster I never thought I'd have to deal with was a bad haircut. That was, until I heard about Cutting Edge Cuts and their hair disaster recovery plan. I decided to give them a try. They came to my office and gave me a perfect haircut without interrupting my workday. It was so convenient and the hairdressers were professional and friendly. They understood my curly hair and gave me a cut that made my curls look amazing. And if something went wrong, I knew I was covered by the hair disaster recovery plan. I'm a happy customer and I highly recommend Cutting Edge Cuts to any tech professional with curly hair who wants to look sharp and stay focused at work, even in the face of unexpected disasters.",
